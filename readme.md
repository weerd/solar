## SOLAR

This is the second-generation of my information dashboard project. It serves me as the one screen I look at for an overview of things that matter to me. Displays weather, NYC subway delays, breaking news, in-home temperature via NEST thermostat, recent movie release rotten tomato scores, closest CitiBike dock status (how many bikes/docks available), and much more in the works. 

This is currently in development and not yet considered ready for public consumption. 


### Technologies Used

- Laravel 4 as a backend, aggregating data and serving it as nicely formatted JSON
- Backbone for all frontend views
- Pusher for real time data updating
- Respond for on-demand loading of javascript files
